# Introduction #

I believe, **Research** is the craft of shaping questions into stories that never truly end. Each experiment becomes a chapter, each observation a line in a longer narrative carried forward by curiosity.

What I build here—Tesla coils, high-voltage circuits, and other experimental setups—is part of that ongoing story. Every project is self-designed and tested from first principles, guided by an interest in understanding how physical systems behave when pushed to their limits. Some designs perform exactly as expected; others reveal their lessons in more surprising ways. But each iteration brings a clearer understanding.

Over time, these experiments have taken form as progressively refined Tesla coil designs—*Mark I, Mark II, Mark III,…..*—each with its own circuit architecture, constraints, and performance characteristics. My focus is not only on building these systems but on documenting how they work, why they work, and how their behaviour changes with different design choices.

This site serves as a technical record: circuit diagrams, construction notes, measurements, analysis, and reflections on unexpected outcomes. It is meant for anyone who appreciates systematic experimentation, unconventional problem-solving, and the process of learning by building.

If your interest lies in how ideas evolve into functioning hardware—and how each iteration opens a new chapter—then you may find this space worth exploring.
