# Introduction #

This site is a documentation of my experiments. I build Tesla coils and high-voltage circuits from scratch, often with weird constraints like, "*no driver ICs*," "*no epoxy*," "*no measurement devices*," or "*let's see what happens if I just... try it*." 

Everything here is self-built, self-tested and driven by curiosity. Sometimes things work beutifully, sometimes they explode. The thrill of seeing glowing arcs keeps me chasing better and bolder versions of Tesla coils - each one gets a name: *Mark I*, *Mark II*, etc.
