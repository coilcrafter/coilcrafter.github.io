# Introduction #

This site is a documentation of my experiments. I build Tesla coils and high-voltage circuits from scratch, often with weird constraints like, "*no driver ICs*," "*no epoxy*," "*no measurement devices*," or "*let's see what happens if I just... try it*."  I share circuit designs, experimental notes, observations, and the ocassional unexpected arcs.

Everything here is self-built, self-tested and driven by curiosity. Sometimes things work beutifully, sometimes they explode. The thrill of seeing glowing arcs keeps me chasing better and bolder versions of Tesla coils - each one gets a name: *Mark I*, *Mark II*, *Mark III* etc. Each version has its own specifications and circuit. 

If you are into weird builds, unconventional design approaches, and a bit of creative chaos in electronics, or just want to see what happens when curiosity meets high-voltage, then you are at the right place. No team, no lab funding - just a soldering iron, some stubbornness, and love for things that hum, glow, and ocassionally blow up.

**Disclaimer:** *Built for sparks. Not for safety*.
